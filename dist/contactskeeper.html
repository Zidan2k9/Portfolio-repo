    A full stack web app for storing contacts created using the MERN stack

      <h3>Created using: <span class="text-secondary">JSX, CSS, MongoDB, Express, React and Node</span></h3>

      <br>

      <p>A web app where users can store contact information (name, email and phone number). Users must first register and login to use the app. I created this app to help me improve my skills in full stack web development. By completing this project I have gained the knowledge and skills required to create, test and connect a custom API with the front end</p>
      <p>The first phase of the project involved creating a custom API using Express that would allow the user to register, login and perform CRUD operations for a contact object. Postman was used to test the various requests on a local server.</p>
      <p>I chose MongoDB to store object information regarding a user and their contacts. Sensitive information was hashed using bcrypt. </p>
      <p>For the front end side of the, the functionality was implemented using a component based approach. Contact information, contact filtering, the contact form and animations had their own seperate components.</p>
      <p>Hooks were used to break down app functionality in the following structure: State, Context and Reducer. State and Context files contained a component's functionality while a reducer was used to communicate with the MongoDB cluster.  The components for the contacts, alerts and user authentication were implemented using this structure.</p>
      <p>JSON Web Tokens provided a layer of authentication to prevent non-logged in users from accessing private routes. Each user is assigned their own web token, the web token is destroyed upon logging out, ensuring that a user's contacts are not visible to anyone else.</p>
