      <br>

      <p>Escape is a 2D hack and slash game that was developed by a group of 4 people including myself. The game contains 2 characters: an archer and a brute. These characters have been trapped in the king's castle and the objective is to escape beyond the castle walls. The archer is quick, agile and delivers damage to enemies in short bursts while the brute is slow and delivers a devastating amount of damage that needs to be replenished. The more enemies and challenges overcome the more XP points the player will gain. Gain enough XP points and the characters will level up to access new abilities and deliver more damage.</p>

      <p>My role within the team was to design, implement and test the game's GUI system which includes health, mana(magic) and XP bars. I also implemented and tested the character switching mechanism. The characters can be switched using the Num1 and Num2 keys. I was also given the task of designing and testing a main menu. This was achieved by using a Unity Asset called Necromancer GUI that can be found <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/gui/necromancer-gui-366"><span class="text-secondary">here</span></a>. The menu's unique design and functionality was scripted using C#.</p>
